# Finals Task 2: Transforming ER Model to Relational Tables

## Overview
This task involves **developing and structuring** a relational database derived from an **ER model** that tracks student assignment submissions. Converted all entities and attributes into MySQL tables including *Student, Assignment, and Submission*. Established well-defined primary and foreign keys while ensuring accurate relationship modeling to maintain referential integrity.

## Step 1: Designing the Students Table
- Establish a table to store student records.
- Ensure each student has a unique identifier (username) with a maximum of 50 characters.
- Set the username as the primary key to prevent duplicates.

## Step 2: Designing the Assignments Table
- Create a table to store details of assignments.
- Define a short name (shortname) as the unique identifier for each assignment.
- Include a due date field, ensuring it cannot be left empty.
- Add an optional URL field to store related links, allowing null values when no URL is provided.

## Step 3: Designing the Submissions Table
- Develop a table that connects students to their assignments.
- Ensure that submissions link a student (username) to an assignment (shortname).
- Allow version tracking, enabling multiple submissions per student per assignment.
- Include a submission date field to record the exact time of submission.
- Provide a data field to store the actual content of the submission.
- Maintain referential integrity by linking students and assignments through foreign keys.
